AIDE-AI and IoT eneabled home automation system for Disabled and Elderly

Description:

It is a glove-based system which allows the disabled and the elderly to control devices with gestures. Simultaneously, it allows their caretakers and
family members to monitor their behaviour through a mobile application.

-Developed a gesture controlled glove and a wrist band using flex sensors, Arduino microcontroller and a Bluetooth module.

-Devised a Raspberry Pi hub which collects the data from the glove and appropriately turns a device on or off.

-Built an AI agent using LSTM with two models-Activity recognition and Fall Detection which are trained and tested on real time dataset.

-Developed an android mobile application to monitor the activities of patients and status of devices using Firebase Firestore database.

Technologies Used:
IoT, AI, Firebase, Android
